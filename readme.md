phpnews
=======

news.php.net is ugly, not mobile friendly, and not easily API accessible. This project's goal is to wrap the existing
site to solve all three of these issues, starting with the last one first.

A live version of this project, running on nginx + php 5.6, can be found at http://phpne.ws.

See composer.json for slightly more information.
